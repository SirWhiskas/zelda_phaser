# zelda_phaser
2D zelda runner using Phaser v2.4.6


This is my first game using JS. All of the assets where downloaded from sources such as https://www.spriters-resource.com/ and
Google image searches

This is an old project (since it's using Phaser v2.4.6) and I plan to upgrade a newer version once I get a good handle on how I 
can better organize my code and use a better design pattern for JS game development.
